# 📚 Library Management System (Prototype V1)

A simple **console-based Library Management System** built in Java.  
This is my **first project after a month of learning Java**, created to practice **OOP, collections, and user authentication**.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 **User Authentication** (Admin & Student roles)
- 👤 **Registration & Login System**
- 🛢️ **Database to store usernames & passwords**
- 📖 **Add, Show, Search Books** (by title & author)
- 📦 **Issue & Return Books**
- ✅ **Book Availability Tracking**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java  
- **Data Structures**: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`  
- **Tools**: Java Scanner for input  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asmit159/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system

2. Compile the code:
   javac LibraryManager.java

3.Run the Program:
java LibraryManager

## 🛢️ Database Usage
A existing database sheet (csv) should be present to successfully store usernames and passwords. 

If database file is absent, then the username and password is stored temporarily in the system and the user will not be able to login using the same credentials in the future.

To create a new database sheet, login as root user.   
**Username:** root   
**Password:** Admin123   
And select "Create new Database" from the menu 

## 📌 Future Improvements(To be Done)

This is just a prototype. Planned features:

💾 File / Database storage for persistent data

👥 Track which student issued a book

🖥️ GUI or Web Interface (JavaFX / Spring Boot / MERN stack)

🔍 More advanced search & filtering

(Code cleaned using chatgpt)
